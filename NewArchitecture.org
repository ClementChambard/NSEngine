* New architecture :

You can create an instance of engine / extends -> init + window (given sizes)
from here, override on_create, on_update, on_render, and on_destroy


* TODO LIST:
** TODO Move things used only by a few projects
** TODO Main architecture [1/2]
- [X] define engine interface
- [ ] replace old engine by engine interface
** TODO Camera system [0/5]
- [ ] base camera class/interface
- [ ] redo camera3d
- [ ] redo camera2d
- [ ] redo functions that use those
- [ ] go in projects / modules to fix

** TODO Logging system [0/1]
- [ ] replace Error & pr by logging system
** TODO Audio module [0/3]
- [ ] Load sound files
- [ ] Play sound effect [0/2]
  - [ ] Play a sound
  - [ ] Sound sources
- [ ] Play music [0/2]
  - [ ] Play continuous music
  - [ ] Place loopPoints -> seamless loop
