#+TITLE: NSEngine
#+AUTHOR: Clement Chambard

Team Nano's Game Engine, made with c++ and OpenGL.

This engine is used in some of my projects.

** Structure

- asset : the engine related assets. This directory needs to be placed in the game's asset directory with the name 'engine'

- src : the source code of the engine.

- scripts : some bash and python scripts to help with using the engine.

In an older version (still used in one of my project), there used to be a file called resources.nsr that would fill the src/assets.cpp and src/assets.h files when using scripts/createAssetFile.py.
If the project you are trying to compile complains about one of these files, run the script in the project's root directory.

** Compile

Copy or link the engine folder as a subdirectory of the project. CMake will take care of compiling the engine when compiling your project.
